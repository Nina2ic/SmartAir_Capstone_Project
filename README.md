# SmartAir_Capstone_Project

<b>Introduction</b>

 The Smart Air  Humidifier project needed hardware parts such as different sensors, mainly DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor, Load Cell, Hx711, Student lab kit and the development platform, Raspberry pi. The responsibility is shared amongst each group member to assemble hardware and make sure sensors were functioning on their own before it is connected to the firebase. The list of items needed for this project, corresponding cost and the total cost are listed below.


<h4>Items to purchase	Cost per hardware</h4>

Raspberry pi kit	114.47
DHT22 Sensor	36.11
Hx711 Load cell Amplifier	16.11
Fusion PCB	30.94
ToTal	197.63


<h4>Duration of time spent on each part of the project</h4>
Raspberry pi an estimate of 3 weeks
Dht22 sensor an estimated time of 5 weeks
Hx711 loadcell amplifier an estimated time on two week
The estimated time to complete this project is by week fourteen. Acquiring the necessary parts, PCB printing and PCB soldering perform a significant function in completing the project. Also, having any relevant experience with any of the elements as mentioned above will reduce the duration of spent on each part completion time



<h4>Designed circuit Diagram</h4>
RPI to connect to power the sensor with a 3.3v pin for my development board.  Added a 10K pull-up resistor(R2) to the power pin 1, then from R2 to Vcc. Pin 4 of the sensor is connected to the ground. The data signal directly connects the digital signal and is connected by a 1Km ohm resistor with VCC. It is something like Digital> 1Km ohm > VCC. 
•	GPI04 to pin 1
•	Connect Wire from RPI to GND
